C - Grand daddy.
Assembly - Fastest
Java - Most popular language, large libraries.
Scala - JVM. spark is written in it.
Scheme - Smaller lisp, popular in universities
Python - Good for automation
Julia - Python like Fast. Best from both places.
Haskell - Functional abstraction
Clojure - Parallelism
Erlang - Hot swapping
Prolog - Declarative specifications

 Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).
